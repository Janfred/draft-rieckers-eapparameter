--- abstract

This document specifies an extension to X509v3 certificates for EAP-TLS
servers to mitigate some flaws in the specification to the use of TLS in
EAP as specified in RFC5216. The specified extension enables clients to
decide whether to trust the certificate presented by the EAP-TLS server
by including information implicitly defined by login credentials or
communication context in the server certificate.

# Introduction

Logging in with EAP-TLS based methods is a widely used mechanism for
password based login with protocols like RADIUS {{RFC2865}}. Two
mechanisms used in WPA2-Enterprise areas are EAP-TTLSv0 and EAP-PEAPv0.
Unfortunately, the specification of EAP-TLS does not specify how the
EAP-TLS peer can verify that the certificate presented by the server is
valid apart from the Key Usage identifiers and user set configuration
parameters.

The configuration parameters include especially the information about
the trust anchor and the expected domain.

In contrast to the usage of X509v3 certificates in other contexts, such
as HTTPS, in EAP-TLS the expected name can not be distinguished from the
context of the communication. This requires users to configure their
supplicants accordingly. Especially in large setups with private devices
this has led to insecure configurations with insufficient or even wrong
name checks. Some security considerations for EAP-TLS in deployment in
eduroam have been named in {{RFC7593}}, Section 7.1.

The same basic security considerations apply for the certificate based
login methods as they apply for password based methods, but are not that
critical, since an attacker can not gain knowledge of the supplicant's
private key with an attack based on insufficient server certificate
validation done by the peer.

The aim of the extension introduced in this document is to give EAP-TLS
peers an option to check the certificate of the EAP-TLS server against
parameters implicitly defined by the communication context.

# Definitions

## Requirements Language

{::boilerplate bcp14}

## Terminology

Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts used in
EAP {{RFC3748}} and EAP-TLS {{RFC5216}}.

In particular, this document frequently uses the following terms:

EAP-TLS server:

: The entity that authenticates the clients and is termination point of
  the EAP-TLS tunnel.

peer or supplicant:

: The client that authenticates to the server in order to gain access to
  the protected resource.

EAP Identity:

: The Identity sent by the peer in the first (unencrypted) EAP
  Identity Response as specified in {{RFC3748}} Section 5.1.

# Syntax

TODO  
There shall be a ASN.1 module in {{asn1module}}

The EAP Parameter extension has the following format:

id-pe-eapparameter OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe XX }

    EAPParameterValues ::= SEQUENCE {
        EAPParameterType    OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
        EAPParameterValue   OCTET STRING
    }

EAPParameter ::= SEQUENCE OF (1..MAX) EAPParameterValues

The extnValue of the id-pe-eapparameter extension is the ASN.1 DER
encoding of the EAPParameter structure.

The EAP Parameter extension MAY be marked as critical.
Certificate Authorities SHOULD allow both, critical and not critical, in
their application process for a certificate with this extension, so
applicants can choose.
Making the extension critical may not be desirable in the early future
after the release of this RFC, but, when marked critical, it will help
forcing users to update their devices, which might be, at least in the
authors opinion, a good idea.
This makes use of the specification of the handling of critical
extensions, specified in {{RFC5280}}: Any supplicant not understanding a
critical extension MUST reject the certificate if it does not understand
this extension.

# EAP Parameter Types

This RFC specifies several EAP Parameter Types. Other parameter types
MAY be specified in the future. The handling of new parameters is
described in {{futureparameters}}

## Realm Suffix types

The Realm Suffix types can be used to bind the certificate to a specific
realm.
It is either a realm separated by '@' (EAPPARAMETERBASEOID.1) or a realm
separated by '%' (EAPPARAMETERBASEOID.2)

TODO: Reference to NAI {{RFC7542}} for Realms. Maybe even remove the '%'
seperated realm, since I have not found any usage. This is only here
because it is in a default configuration file of FreeRADIUS

TODO: Replace EAPPARAMETERBASEOID with assigned OID

### Syntax

The EAPParameterValue for these types is a DER-encoded UTF8String
containing the full realm of the outer username. This is supposed to be
a FQDN. It MAY not be a FQDN for testing purposes but MUST NOT contain
the separator character, depending on the Suffix type.  The value MAY
contain one asterisk to indicate a wildcard validity for all realms
under a specific domain. The asterisk MUST be the first character and
MUST be followed by a dot.  A certificate containing only an asterisk
and a dot MUST NOT be issued by a trusted certificate authority.

### Validation

To verify the supplicant will compare the sent EAP Identity with the
realm contained in the EAPParameterValue. If the EAPParameterValue is
not in a valid format, the supplicant MUST reject the certificate and
SHOULD send a fatal bad_certificate alert (see {{RFC5246}}, {{RFC8446}}).
If the value contains an asterisk, the realm part should be matched as
the dnsName of subjectAltName attribute would be matched.

### CA Requirements

A trusted CA MUST validate that the applicant is authorized to request
certificates under the domain represented by the realm. CAs SHOULD rely
additionally on the CAA issuewild DNS value and SHOULD NOT issue a
certificate with this extension if the CAA value forbids wildcard
certificates.

## Identity

EAPPARAMETERBASEOID.3

The Identity Parameter Type can be used to bind the server certificate
to use with a specific EAP Identity.

### Syntax

The EAPParameterValue for this type is a DER-encoded UTF8String
containing the full EAP Identity.

The value MAY contain up to two asterisks, one for the local part of the
Identity, one for the realm. This can be used to allow EAP-Identities
with variable parts. If two asterisks are used, the certificate
extension MUST also contain a EAPParameter for verification of the Realm
(e.g. Realm Suffix, separated by '@')

The asterisk for the realm part follows the same rules as described in
the Realm suffix type.

The asterisk for the local part MAY be at any position.

### Validation

To verify this parameter the supplicant has to verify the sent EAP
Identity and the parameter value in the certificate match. The
supplicant SHOULD do this with a case insensitive comparison.

TODO: Here should also be a description how to deal with asterisks.

### CA Requirements

The CA requirements for this type depend on the used Identity format.

If the Identity is in a format that would also allow Realm Suffix Types
(e.g.  separated by @ or %) for the domain part the same CA Requirements
as for the defined Realm Suffix Types apply. CAs SHOULD allow the
local part to be chosen by the certificate requestor inside normal
parameters.

Globally trusted CAs MUST NOT issue certificates with the Identity EAP
Parameter Type if it does not contain a Realm or the Realm can not be
mapped to a DNS name.

## Login Medium

EAPPARAMETERBASEOID.4

TODO  
This is intended to limit the validity of the certificate to e.g. 802.1x
authentication

# IANA Considerations

TODO: Here the IANA considerations should be updated. The decimal id of
the id-pe-eapparameter will be registered once the draft has reached a
state where proof of concept implementations can be made.

On approval, IANA shall add in the SMI Security for PKIX Certificate
Extension (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.1) registry the following entry:

|Deciamal|Description        |References|
|--------|-------------------|----------|
|XX      |id-pe-eapparameter |{this RFC}|

Additionally the IANA shall install a new registry for PKIX Certificate
Extension EAP Parameter Types for the parameter types
with the following initial content:

|Decimal|Description                     | References |
|-------|--------------------------------|------------|
|1      |Realm Suffix, separated by '@'  | {this RFC} |
|2      |Realm Suffix, separated by '%'  | {this RFC} |
|3      |Identity                        | {this RFC} |
|4      |Login Medium                    | {this RFC} |


TODO: Here there may be also defined Realm Prefix Types (e.g.
WINDOWS-NET/username). Obviously this can't be issued by a globally
trusted CA, but might be issued by a company CA

Further EAP Parameter Types may be registered in future. New
registration requests MUST include a detailed description how peers
should validate the given parameter and a detailed description for
Certificate Authorities how they must verify the authorization of a
certificate request with this parameter.

# Security Considerations

TODO  
There will be security considerations. There are security considerations
which lead to this draft.

Here might be a reference to {{RFC4334}}. It specifies X509v3 extensions to help the supplicant to choose the client certificate used for login based on connection parameters such as SSID or Login Medium.

There will be acknowledgements. I haven't done the work all by myself
and a lot of people should and will be listed here for supporting me in
all my work.
